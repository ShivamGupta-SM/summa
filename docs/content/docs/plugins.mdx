description: Extend Summa with reconciliation, snapshots, velocity limits, and more.

## Available Plugins

Summa ships with six built-in plugins:

```ts
import {
  reconciliation,
  snapshots,
  velocityLimits,
  outbox,
  hotAccounts,
  scheduledTransactions,
} from "summa/plugins";
```

## Reconciliation

Runs daily balance reconciliation to detect mismatches between account
balances and their entry records:

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  plugins: [reconciliation({ schedule: "0 2 * * *" })], // 2 AM daily
});
```

## Snapshots

Takes daily snapshots of all account balances for historical reporting:

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  plugins: [snapshots()],
});
```

## Velocity Limits

Enforce transaction limits per account (daily, monthly, per-transaction):

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  plugins: [velocityLimits()],
});

// Set limits on an account
await summa.limits.set({
  accountId: account.id,
  limitType: "daily",
  maxAmount: 10_000_00, // $10,000/day
});
```

## Outbox

Transactional outbox pattern for reliable event publishing:

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  plugins: [outbox()],
});
```

## Hot Accounts

Optimistic concurrency for high-traffic accounts that would otherwise bottleneck
on row-level locks:

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  plugins: [hotAccounts()],
});
```

## Scheduled Transactions

Schedule future or recurring transactions:

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  plugins: [scheduledTransactions()],
});
```
