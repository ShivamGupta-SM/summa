## Creating a Hold

Holds reserve funds in a source account without transferring them yet:

```ts
const hold = await summa.holds.create({
  sourceHolderId: "user_123",
  destinationHolderId: "merchant_1",
  amount: 100_00, // $100.00
  currency: "USD",
  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 7 days
});
```

The source account's `pendingDebit` increases by the hold amount.

## Capturing a Hold

Capture converts a hold into a posted transaction:

```ts
// Full capture
const txn = await summa.holds.capture({ holdId: hold.id });

// Partial capture — only charge what was used
const txn = await summa.holds.capture({
  holdId: hold.id,
  amount: 75_00, // Only capture $75.00 of the $100.00 hold
});
```

## Voiding a Hold

Void releases the reserved funds without charging:

```ts
await summa.holds.void({ holdId: hold.id });
```

## Expiry

When a hold expires, it can no longer be captured. The reserved funds are
automatically released when the hold is next accessed or when the scheduled
cleanup worker runs.
