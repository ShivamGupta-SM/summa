## Overview

Summa supports **multi-tenancy** through a "ledger-as-namespace" pattern. Each ledger is a fully isolated namespace — accounts, transactions, system accounts, event chains, and idempotency keys are all scoped per-ledger. A single Summa instance can serve multiple tenants without data leakage.

This is the same isolation pattern used by production financial ledgers and banking platforms.

## How It Works

Five boundary tables carry a `ledger_id` column:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `account` | All account lookups filter by ledger (includes system accounts with `is_system = true`) |
| `transfer` | Same reference is OK across different ledgers |
| `idempotency_key` | Same key is OK across different ledgers |
| `entry` | Hash chain integrity is per-ledger (via `sequence_number`) |
| `block_checkpoint` | Merkle tree blocks are per-ledger |

Other tables (`merkle_node`, `entity_status_log`, etc.) are isolated through foreign key chains — no `ledger_id` needed.

## Creating a Ledger

```ts
const ledger = await summa.ledgers.create({
  name: "Acme Corp",
  metadata: { plan: "enterprise" },
});

console.log(ledger.id); // UUID
```

Every ledger automatically gets its own set of system accounts (@World, @Fees, etc.).

## Sending the Ledger ID

Every API call must include a `ledgerId` — either in the request body or via the `X-Ledger-Id` header:

<Tabs items={["Request body", "HTTP header", "Programmatic"]}>
<Tab value="Request body">

```json
{
  "holderId": "user_123",
  "holderType": "individual",
  "currency": "USD",
  "ledgerId": "ledger-uuid-here"
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="HTTP header">

```http
POST /accounts HTTP/1.1
X-Ledger-Id: ledger-uuid-here
Content-Type: application/json

{ "holderId": "user_123", "holderType": "individual", "currency": "USD" }
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Programmatic">

```ts
const summa = createSumma({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db),
  currency: "USD",
  ledgerId: "ledger-uuid-here", // Set at instance level
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Isolation Guarantees

<Cards>
  <Card title="Account Isolation">
    The same `holderId` can exist in different ledgers. Each gets its own account with independent balances.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference Isolation">
    Transaction references and idempotency keys are scoped per-ledger. The same reference can be reused across tenants.
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Account Isolation">
    Each ledger has its own @World system account. Credits and debits are fully contained within the ledger.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event Chain Isolation">
    Hash chains and Merkle tree block checkpoints are per-ledger. Integrity verification is scoped to individual tenants.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Listing Ledgers

```ts
const ledgers = await summa.ledgers.list();
// [{ id: "...", name: "Acme Corp", ... }, ...]

const ledger = await summa.ledgers.get("ledger-uuid-here");
```

## API Routes

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/ledgers` | Create a new ledger |
| `GET` | `/ledgers` | List all ledgers |
| `GET` | `/ledgers/:id` | Get a specific ledger |

## Schema

The `ledger` table stores tenant metadata:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `name` | VARCHAR(255) | Ledger name |
| `metadata` | JSONB | Custom metadata |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Creation time |

<Callout type="info" title="Indirect FK Isolation">
  Only 5 tables carry a `ledger_id` column. The remaining tables inherit isolation through foreign key chains — for example, `merkle_node` belongs to a `block_checkpoint` which belongs to a ledger. This keeps the schema clean and minimizes the migration surface.
