## Posting a Transaction

Every transaction moves funds between two accounts using double-entry
bookkeeping — one debit, one credit:

```ts
const txn = await summa.transactions.post({
  sourceHolderId: "user_123",
  destinationHolderId: "merchant_1",
  amount: 50_00, // $50.00 in cents
  currency: "USD",
  reference: "order_abc",
  description: "Payment for Order #ABC",
});
```

## Reversals

Reverse a posted transaction to undo the balance changes:

```ts
const reversal = await summa.transactions.reverse({
  transactionId: txn.id,
  reason: "Customer refund",
});
```

## Idempotency

Use idempotency keys to safely retry operations:

```ts
const txn = await summa.transactions.post({
  sourceHolderId: "user_123",
  destinationHolderId: "merchant_1",
  amount: 50_00,
  currency: "USD",
  reference: "order_abc",
  idempotencyKey: "pay_order_abc_v1",
});
```

Retrying with the same key returns the original result without double-posting.

## System Accounts

System accounts represent your platform's own accounts (revenue, fees,
float, etc.):

```ts
// Transactions can reference system accounts
const txn = await summa.transactions.post({
  sourceHolderId: "user_123",
  destinationSystemAccountId: "platform_fees",
  amount: 2_50, // $2.50 fee
  currency: "USD",
  reference: "fee_order_abc",
});
```
