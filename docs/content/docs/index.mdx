description: Install and configure Summa in your TypeScript project.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add summa @summa/core
```

You also need a database adapter. Pick one:

```bash
# Drizzle ORM (recommended)
pnpm add @summa/drizzle-adapter drizzle-orm

# Prisma
pnpm add @summa/prisma-adapter @prisma/client

# Kysely
pnpm add @summa/kysely-adapter kysely

# In-memory (for testing)
pnpm add @summa/memory-adapter
```

## Quick Start

```ts
import { createSumma } from "summa";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "@summa/drizzle-adapter";
import { reconciliation, snapshots } from "summa/plugins";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);

const summa = createSumma({
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(db),
  currency: "USD",
  plugins: [reconciliation(), snapshots()],
});
```

## Core Concepts

Summa is an **event-sourced double-entry financial ledger**. Every mutation
produces an immutable event with a SHA-256 hash chain for tamper detection.

- **Accounts** hold balances with credit/debit tracking
- **Transactions** move money between accounts with double-entry guarantees
- **Holds** reserve funds with optional expiry
- **Events** form an append-only log with hash chain integrity
- **Plugins** add reconciliation, snapshots, velocity limits, and more

## Next Steps

- [Accounts](/docs/accounts) — create and manage accounts
- [Transactions](/docs/transactions) — post transfers and reversals
- [Holds](/docs/holds) — reserve and capture funds
- [Plugins](/docs/plugins) — extend with reconciliation, snapshots, and more
