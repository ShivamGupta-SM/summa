## Creating an Account

```ts
const account = await summa.accounts.create({
  holderId: "user_123",
  holderType: "customer",
  currency: "USD",
});
```

Every account tracks:

- `balance` — net balance (credits minus debits)
- `creditBalance` / `debitBalance` — running totals
- `pendingCredit` / `pendingDebit` — reserved amounts from holds
- `status` — `active`, `frozen`, or `closed`

## Account Indicators

You can assign a unique indicator for human-friendly lookups:

```ts
const account = await summa.accounts.create({
  holderId: "user_123",
  holderType: "customer",
  currency: "USD",
  indicator: "ACC-001",
});

// Look up by indicator
const found = await summa.accounts.getByIndicator("ACC-001");
```

## Freezing an Account

Frozen accounts reject all transactions but preserve their state:

```ts
await summa.accounts.freeze({
  accountId: account.id,
  reason: "Suspicious activity",
  frozenBy: "admin@example.com",
});
```

## Unfreezing

```ts
await summa.accounts.unfreeze({ accountId: account.id });
```

## Closing an Account

Closed accounts are permanent. If there's a remaining balance, you must sweep
funds to another account:

```ts
await summa.accounts.close({
  accountId: account.id,
  closedBy: "admin@example.com",
  reason: "Customer request",
  transferToHolderId: "treasury",
});
```

## Overdrafts

By default, accounts reject transactions that would result in a negative
balance. Enable overdrafts per account:

```ts
const account = await summa.accounts.create({
  holderId: "merchant_1",
  holderType: "merchant",
  currency: "USD",
  allowOverdraft: true,
  overdraftLimit: 100_00, // $100.00 in cents
});
```
